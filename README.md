# Learning-Scrapbook

## Purpose: This repository will be used as a Sandbox mode where I can have fun learning. I want to be able to experiment and learn certain topics/techniques of interest. This will be used like an encyclopedia where I can look back at things Ive documented in the past. Some topics include:
  - Mathematics
  - Statistics
  - Computer Science
  - Data Structures and Algorithms
  - Data Science and Machine Learning
  - Computer Vision
